It's been a rough couple of weeks. I had everything planned out from the day I started this program to the day I would graduate. My grandfather had been feeling unwell, fatigued so he went in for a check up. His doctor ran some tests and discovered a growing tumor. He lives a couple states away, but with only my grandmother there, my mother and I drove up to take care of him and the hospital visits. The doctors told us that he would be okay, after they removed the tumor. Now that he has had a successful surgery, I have returned back home to NJ.

I was on the pre-med track during my undergraduate years. I took my biology classes and interned at a physician's office. It wasn't until this past summer that I started looking into coding. I checked out some free online courses just to see what it was like. Turns out I really, really enjoyed coding. I spent the rest of the summer learning the basics of coding, Python to be exact. It was then that I started to realize that maybe this was my true passion, something I enjoyed putting my time and effort into. I still enjoy healthcare and have decided that in the future I will pursue a career that can incorporate both software development and healthcare.
