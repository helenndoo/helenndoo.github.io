HTML vs HTML5
HTML was the first markup language that was developed strictly for web-browser use. HTML5 is the fifth markup language and the standard for web development today. To understand HTML5, you must first understand HTML. HTML is used to change the physical appearance of a web page through usage of tags that are hidden by the browser. For example, using <bold> hello </bold>, you have just turned the word "hello", bold. That is just one example of tags and how HTML uses them to structure and present content. With it, developers can publish online documents and present information using headings, texts, and photos, manipulating them however they see fit. It's a very powerful and versatile tool, once you understand how to utilize it.

HTML5 is like the new and updated version of HTML. As with most newer forms of technology, it is more efficient, versatile, and compatible with more browsers than HTML was. One of the best advantages to using HTML5 as opposed to HTML is its ability to development applications cross-platforms. This allows developers to create web applications faster and in a more structured way. So top 3 advantages: 1. browser compatibility, 2. mobile friendly!, 3. scripts and plug-ins. Browser compatibility, as mentioned before, allows HTML5 to be used across all the major browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer (and more). Mobile friendly is a plus because we currently live in a world where people of all ages are controlled by and addicted to our mobile devices. To be able to create platforms utilized by mobile devices means being able to reach millions more people. Scripts and plug-ins; HTML5 allows cliend-side scripts to be added or embedded using the <script> tags. 

We've established that HTML5 is a powerful and versatile tool in modern day web development, but something this great must be difficult to learn right? Not necessarily, but there are some common mistakes that can be avoided. The number one mistake, in my opinion, is expecting there to be compatibility among all browsers. We said earlier that one of the top three advantages to HTML5 is its browser compatibility so how could assuming browser compatibility be a mistake? The key here is the word "assuming". It's true that it is compatible with many, many browsers, but what you should remember is that HTML5 interpretation can be very, very different across different browsers. Different browsers play by different rules, so there is no set group of features or base to follow. You have to learn the elements of each separate browser in order to optimize your coding on that specific browser.
